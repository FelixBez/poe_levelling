# poe_levelling
Nodejs website to follow poe levelling steps.

I create this projet to test NodeJS server and create a little tool to follow poe levelling steps. It's entirely inspired by https://poe-leveling.com/.

## TODO
- Improve css
- Register progression (in a simple file maybe?)
- Separate text data in another file than client.js
- Dockerize the project
